# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI

### About

Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Execute the program and get playing!

You can play human versus human, or human versus bot. Also you can watch the game between two bots. 

The bot has three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard.

The easy difficulty level makes random moves. 
The medium difficulty level tries to win when it can in the next move, or blocks the user when he would win in the next move. 
The hard difficulty level makes use of minimax to guess the best outcome from all possible moves.
